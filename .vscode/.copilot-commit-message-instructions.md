# How to Write Commit Messages (Conventional Commits)

Always write commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

- `<type>`: Type of change (required)
- `<scope>`: Scope of the change (optional)
- `<subject>`: Short description of the change (max 50 characters, start with a lowercase letter, no period at the end)

## Common types

- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, etc.)
- refactor: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- perf: Performance improvements
- test: Adding or updating tests
- chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

## Examples

```
feat: add button component
fix(App): fix crash on initial render
docs: update setup instructions in README
```
